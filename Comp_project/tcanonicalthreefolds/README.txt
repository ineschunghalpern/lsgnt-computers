The classification of toric canonical Fano 3-folds
--------------------------------------------------

This dataset describes the classification of all toric canonical Fano 3-folds [1]. Equivalently, it describes the classification of all 3-dimensional convex lattice polytopes with exactly one interior lattice point.

A toric Fano 3-fold X (that is, a 3-dimensional toric variety with ample anticanonical divisor -K) with at worst canonical singularities corresponds to a 3-dimensional convex polytope P with vertices that are primitive integer vectors, and such that P contains exactly one lattice point, the origin, in its strict interior. The fan of X is given by the spanning fan of P: that is, the fan whose cones are spanned by the faces of P. In the language of toric geometry, P is in the lattice N = Z^3. Since two polytopes which are equal after a lattice change of basis give rise to isomorphic toric varieties, a polytope is regarded as being defined only up to the action of GL(Z^3). There are 674688 isomorphism classes.

We fix some notation. Let:
	* N = Z^3 be a lattice of rank 3;
	* P denote the lattice polytope in N defined by the key:value record;
	* F denote the spanning fan in N of P;
	* X denote the toric Fano 3-fold corresponding to F;
	* M = Hom(N,Z) denote the lattice dual to N;
	* P^* denote the (rational) polytope in M dual to P (also called the polar polytope);
	* -K denote the anticanonical divisor of X.

The keys and values are as follows.

id: A unique integer ID for this record, in the range 1 to 674688.
num_vertices: A positive integer. The number of vertices #vert(P) of P. Equivalently, the number of rays of F. By duality this is also equal to the number of 2-dimensional faces of P^*.
num_faces: A positive integer. The number of 2-dimensional faces of P. Equivalently, the number of top-dimensional cones of F. By duality this is also equal to the number of vertices of P^*.
num_points: A positive integer. The number of lattice points #(P \cap N).
is_terminal: A boolean. True if and only if X has at worst terminal singularities. Equivalently, true if and only if the only lattice points on the boundary of P are the vertices of P; that is, P \cap N = vert(P) \cup {0}.
is_simplicial: A boolean. True if and only if P is simplicial. Equivalently, true if and only if X is Q-factorial. By duality, this is true if and only if P^* is simple.
is_regular: A boolean. True if and only if X is smooth. Equivalently, true if and only if every 2-dimensional face of P is a triangle whose vertices Z-generate the lattice N. If is_regular is true then both is_simplicial and is_terminal must be true.
is_reflexive: A boolean. True if and only if X is Gorenstein; that is, -K is Cartier. Equivalently, true if and only if P^* is a lattice polytope.
vertex_list: A sequence of lattice points in N. The vertices vert(P) of P. Equivalently, the primitive lattice generators of the rays of F. The number of points is given by num_vertices.
point_list: A sequence of lattice points in N. The lattice points P \cap N. The number of points is given by num_points.
dual_list: A sequence of rational points in M. The vertices vert(P^*) of P^*. These will be lattice points if and only if is_reflexive is true. The number of points is given (via duality) by num_faces.
ehrhart_delta: A sequence (1,a_1,a_2,1) of four integers, the first and last of which are always 1. This is the Ehrhart delta-vector (or h*-vector) of P. The Ehrhart series Ehr(P) of P is given by Ehr(P) = (1 + a_1*t + a_2*t^2 + t^3) / (1 - t)^4.
hilbert_delta: A sequence (b_0,b_1,...,b_N) of integers such that b_i = b_(N - i), and b_0 = b_N = 1. This is called the Ehrhart delta-vector (or h*-vector) of P^*. Write N = 4*r - 1. Then r is the quasiperiod of P^*, and r divides gorenstein_index. The Ehrhart series of P^* is given by Ehr(P^*) = (b_0 + b_1*t + ... + b_N*t^N) / (1 - t^r)^4. The Ehrhart series Ehr(P^*) of P^* is equal to the Hilbert series Hilb(X,-K).
normal_form: A sequence of lattice points in N. The PALP normal form of the vertices of P; see [2,3].
volume: A positive integer. The lattice-normalised volume Vol(P) of P. This is equal to the sum of the ehrhart_delta: Vol(P) = 1 + a_1 + a_2 + 1.
degree: A positive integer. The anticanonical degree (-K)^3 of X. Equivalently, the lattice-normalised volume Vol(P^*) of P^*.
gorenstein_index: A positive integer. The Gorenstein index of X; that is, the smallest multiple m>0 such that -mK is Cartier. Equivalently, the smallest multiple m>0 such that mP^* is a lattice polytope. This is 1 if and only if is_reflexive is true.
h1,...,h10: Positive integers. The value hi is equal to the number of lattice points in the i-th dilation of P^*, that is, hi = #(iP^* \cap M). Equivalently, hi = h^0(X,-iK). The values hi can also be obtained from Ehr(P^*), or equivalently from Hilb(X,-K), via the power-series expansion (b_0 + b_1*t + ... + b_N*t^N) / (1 - t^r)^4 = 1 + h1*t + h2*t^2 + h3*t^3 + ..., where (b_0,b_1,...,b_N) is given by hilbert_delta.
e1,...,e10: Positive integers. The value ei is equal to the number of lattice points in the i-th dilation of P, that is, ei = #(iP \cap N). In particular, e1 is equal to num_points. The values ei can also be obtained from Ehr(P) via the power-series expansion (1 + a_1*t + a_2*t^2 + t^3) / (1 - t)^4 = 1 + e1*t + e2*t^2 + e3*t^3 + ..., where (1,a_1,a_2,1) is given by ehrhart_delta.
picard_rank: Positive integer. The rank of the Picard group of X. When is_simplicial is true, this is equal to #vert(P) - 3.
automorphism_order: Positive integer. The order of the automorphism group Aut(P) <= GL(Z^3) of P.
is_barycentre_zero: A boolean. True if and only if the barycentre of P is equal to the origin in N.
is_dual_barycentre_zero: A boolean. True if and only if the barycentre of P^* is equal to the origin in M.
